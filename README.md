# ECEN 427 Student Template Repository
 
 * **device_tree:** This folder contains the Linux Device Tree, which enumerates all hardware available to the Linux system.  You won't need to modify this until Lab 6, but some of the information in the [device_tree/dts/board_ecen427.dtsi](device tree source) may be helpful to you for Lab 2 and 4.
  * **hw:** This folder contains the hardware design programmed on the FPGA.  You will be modifying the hardware design in Lab 5, and you won't need to access these files before then.
